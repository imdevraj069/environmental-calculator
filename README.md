## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's architecture is designed to be reactive, modular, and efficient.

1.  **State Management (Zustand)**: A central store (`calculatorStore.js`) acts as the single source of truth. It manages the structure of the calculator (`inputs`, `outputs`) and the user's entered values (`data`). The `persist` middleware automatically handles saving the state to and rehydrating from `localStorage`.

2.  **Calculator Builder**: This is the core interactive component. When a user drops a field into a new position, `@hello-pangea/dnd` triggers a reorder action that updates the state, causing the UI to re-render in the new order.

3.  **Dynamic Form**: The `DataInputForm` component subscribes to the `inputs` array in the store and dynamically renders the appropriate form control for each item.

4.  **Real-Time Calculation**: The `ResultsDashboard` listens for changes to both the `outputs` (formulas) and the `data` (values). Whenever a change occurs, it re-evaluates each formula using `math.js`, passing in the current `data` object as the scope for the calculation.
